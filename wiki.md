I have watched *many* different animes through my life. There is *always* a debate on what the best anime is for every year or even in all time but, I will be talking about **my** favorites that I have watched.
Anime has been something I have been watching since I was young and as someone in their early 20s now, I have seen many different ones in many different genres. Below I will be talking about my **favorites**.

## Section 1
### Shoujo / Slice of Life
Out of all the genres, I've watched the most series under the romance / slice of life category. *Something* about high school romance comedies are just pleasing and entertaining for a chill night of anime. A few of my *current* top favorites under this genre would be, "Kaguya-sama Love is War" and "Fruits Basket".

## Section 2
### Action
Hands down any action anime is always entertaining. The animation of the art from the fighting scenes are alwasy very amusing to watch. There are always many action scenes and I find them to be more entertaining than romance animes sometimes. Some of my favorites are, "Attack on Titan" and "Jujutsu Kaisen".

## Section 3
### Comedy / Everything else I've watched
I think I have watched the least amount of anime series from this genre. I find that every series from other genres all incorporate some type of humor so there is never one, from my knowledge, that is just pure comedy. However, one that I did watch that can fall under this category is "Saiki K". More than romance or action, there is much more comedy in this series. Therefore being my favorite for this category.
